QwertyLang (QWL) is a very stupid language based on the QWERTY keys that I made in 1.5 days.
The numbering system is basicly base12 but goes from qq to YY (qwertyQWERTY).
Registers go from qq to YY (144?)

Set(qq): set a register to a value from qq to YY
Example:
Set Register 0 to 12
qqqqwq

Print(qw): print a number, letter, register number, or a register letter
Example:
Print Register letter 3 and Register number 4 and letter 0 (a) and number 3
