# QWERTYLang
QWERTYLang is a stupid esoteric programming language that I made within 1 and a half days.

Sadly this only works for Windows devices, I will add compatibility to linux and maybe macOS.

# Installation
Simply just download the latest release and unzip the folder, There you will have a exe file and a Index.
